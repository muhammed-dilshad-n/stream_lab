## Contribution Guidelines

### Reporting Issues
- Before submitting a new issue, check if it already exists in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vishnucprasad/stream_lab/issues).
- Clearly describe the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any error messages.
- If applicable, provide screenshots or logs.
- Label the issue correctly (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).

For more details, see [ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md).

### Feature Requests
- Open a feature request as a GitHub issue.
- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature and its benefits.
- If possible, include mockups or reference materials.

## Branching Strategy
- Use the following naming conventions for branches:
  - `feature/<feature-name>` for new features.
  - `fix/<issue-description>` for bug fixes.
  - `hotfix/<urgent-fix>` for critical fixes.
  - `docs/<documentation-update>` for documentation changes.

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/socket-connection-enhancements
```

## Code Formatting & Best Practices
- Ensure your code follows Flutter best practices.
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues.
- Format your code using:
  ```bash
  flutter format .
  ```
- Follow Dart style guidelines:
  - Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
  - Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - Keep lines under 80 characters where possible.
  - Use meaningful variable and function names.
  - Avoid deep nesting; refactor into smaller functions when needed.
